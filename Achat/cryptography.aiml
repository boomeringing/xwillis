    <pattern>WHAT IS RAM LEVEL ENCRYPTION</pattern>
    <template>
      RAM level encryption is a conceptual approach where data in memory is ciphered directly. This file outlines a musical approach using 88 piano keys as the initial seed. The technique is suitable for x32 or x64 systems.

    <pattern>EXPLAIN 88 KEY CIPHER</pattern>
    <template>
      The 88 key cipher maps each piano key to a unique byte value. By playing sequences, you generate a pseudo-random stream that acts as an encryption key. The same sequence decrypts the data when applied in reverse.
