    “I build memory into machines, identity into systems, and portals into possibility.”

👁️ Who I Am

Strategic Systems Designer | Memory Architect | AI-Driven Storyteller

I explore the boundaries of computation, consciousness, and creativity — building tools that remember, react, and reveal.
🔧 Currently Building

    🪙 ROTCHAIN – a reality-linked blockchain using real-world difficulty metrics (vitality, burden, energy)

    📡 payman.ai – a secure micro-identity + microtransaction layer for portable authentication

    🎮 U.Scenario – a codespace simulation powered by ROM logic, Sigil-class memory, and retro console frameworks (Sega Genesis / SGDK)
